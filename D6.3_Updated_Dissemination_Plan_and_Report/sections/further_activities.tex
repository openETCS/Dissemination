\section{Further Activities}\label{sct:further_activities}

\subsection{openETCS Website}
With the start of the project a preliminary public project website has been set up and can be reached under \url{http://www.openetcs.org}. In its current state the website gives a brief overview over the project, its goals, and the participating partners. Moreover, a calendar with upcoming events gives people not yet involved but interested in the project an overview of ongoing activities and thus the possibility to participate in these events. Last but not least the website provides links to the project github repository, thus providing access to deliverables, software, meeting minutes, etc.

It is planned to go online with a redesigned and revised website within this year. The revised website will among other things provide more information about the participating partners and each of the working packages.


\subsection{Github}

Throughout the project the GitHub platform \cite{github} is used for management and publication of project results. Many of the project repositories are public and thus are accessible to the outside world, making it possible for everyone to view the state of the project and its results. In addition, the platform enables anybody to contribute content to the project. GitHub is based on the open source Git tool \cite{gittool} and provides a wide variety of functions, including versioning, team collaboration support, public and private repositories and a wiki. In addition to the main project repositories wikis are a useful tool for communicating project state and results to the outside world.
